# smfret-helicase-hmm
Hidden Markov Model for state detection in simulated smFRET traces of RNA-binding proteins

This project simulates single-molecule FRET (smFRET) traces of an RNA-binding protein (e.g., helicase) and applies a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect conformational state transitions.
